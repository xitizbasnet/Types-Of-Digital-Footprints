What Your Digital Footprint Can Say About You

---------------------

It’s a good idea to have a positive digital footprint. This information is your digital identity, and it could show up when someone searches for your name online.

Your online identity can influence different aspects of your life. For example, employers, schools, colleges, and law enforcement officials could use your digital footprint as a basis for character assessment.

Types Of Digital Footprints

---------------------

Digital footprints can be classified into two broad categories — active and passive footprints — which depends on how your information is acquired.

---------------------

:footprints: Active Digital Footprints :footprints:
---------------------

Active digital footprints consist of the data you leave when you make deliberate choices on the internet. For instance, posts you make to your social media channels are a form of active footprint. When you are logged into a project management or similar site, changes you make that are connected to your login name are also part of your active footprint.

---------------------

Here are a few examples of active digital footprints.

:footprints: Passive Digital Footprints :footprints:

---------------------

Passive digital footprints are those you leave behind without intending to or, in some cases, without knowing it.

---------------------

For instance, websites that collect information about how many times you’ve visited recently are adding to your digital footprint in a passive fashion. That’s because you don’t choose to give them this data. They collect it when a device at your IP address connects with their website. This is a hidden process, and you may not realize it is happening at all.

---------------------

Here are three examples of passive digital footprints.

:large_blue_circle: Websites that install cookies in your device without disclosing it to you.

:large_blue_circle: Apps and websites that use geolocation to pinpoint your location.

:large_blue_circle: Social media news channels and advertisers that use your likes, shares, and comments to profile you and to serve up advertisements based on your interests.

Both active and passive footprints can be tracked and observed in multiple ways and by multiple sources.
